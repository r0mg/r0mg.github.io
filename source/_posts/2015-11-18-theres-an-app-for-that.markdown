Two-thirds of the way through our stint here at Flatiron, it seems like we're finally approaching a point where we can incorporate elements of creativity to make our apps fancy and unique. As we prepare to re-enter project mode and ponder the possibilities of what to make, it can be easy to get overwhelmed in the decision process. Not only do we want to build something functionally representative of our skills, we also want it to be one of a kind. This poses quite a challenge given the sheer number of popular apps and web-based concepts that already exist, and it can feel like everything, in some way shape or form, has already been done. In fact, some statistics support this sentiment:
<ul>
<li>There's an over-abundance of choice in the app market. Millions of apps were available for download in the top 3 app stores as of June 2015.
  <ul>
    <li>Apple App Store: 1,500,000
    <li>Google Play: 1,600,000
    <li>Windows Store: 340,000
  </ul>

  <br>
<li>Because users have literal millions of low-risk options in choosing an app to download, they are selective, demanding, impatient and fickle about which ones they use.
<ul>
  <li>Apple App Store: 100 billion cumulative downloads between July 2008 and June 2015.
  <li>Google Play: 50 billion cumulative downloads between August 2010 to July 2013
  <li>Total downloads forecasted to reach 268.69 billion by 2017
  <li>App users in the United States actively use 26.7 apps per month, on average 
</ul>
<br>
<li>Among the comparatively small number of apps that people actively use, the 5 most popular apps by traffic volume dominate 61% of all app traffic

<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>If traffic volume alone isn't persuasive enough, app popularity based on the number unique visitors in a given month is still topped by the usuals: Facebook, YouTube, Google, Pandora, Instagram, Netflix, Snapchat, blah blah blah. 
</ul>
</ul><br>
So how does one stand out among the remaining 1,499,000? Logically, it follows that you need to be very, very unique. In the app market, however, novelty isn't a sustainable competitive advantage. While an emphasis on originality can yield some pretty neat stuff, trying too hard, as with everything else, can be the detrimental to giving people what they want or need (Netflix for Wine?).

The market out there is undoubtedly tough, but the point of this post isn't actually to crush dreams or rag on all of our life choices to become developers. Quite the opposite. In fact, while looking through these dire statistics and related commentary, my first observation was that there can't possibly be a way to determine what any given app is worth based on the available data, because the technology is growing faster than we can assign its value. Second, many successful apps haven't introduced new ideas, but improved upon them. 

Most important, there's also data out there that's detected consistencies among objectively successful apps, the forecasted nature of future of demand, as well as considerations to keep in mind when making decisions in an app-based market, whether it be as a job-seeker assessing the potential growth of a startup employer, or in starting a startup.

<ul>
<li>The less time needed for a user to use, the better. Behavior knows as "app snacking," or logging in for several short sessions of several apps within a day, is prolific.
<li>People stop using apps when they no longer provide value or entertainment. Saving time is of particular value. Successful apps have figured out how to keep the user hooked (ex: Angry Birds).
<li>Survey respondents feel a disconnect between all the digital elements of in their lives and want more integration, i.e. there's need to combine all the apps into one.
<li>Personalization is big, but there are different types of personalization that go beyond stating preferences in the app settings and into what's most relevant (ex. content delivery based on historical data v. real time data v. anticipated actions).
<li>UIs should be simple, minimal and intuitive. Otherwise user gets distracted and moves on to the next one.
<li>App updates should be streamlined - adaptable to changing wants/needs/preferences, and with quick implementation
<li>Too many features is distracting. Developers need to find a way to minimize what the user needs to do and maximize what the app returns.
<li>While there are notable exceptions, and while there may be a few more, the best way to ensure sustainability is to have a functional business model independent of the app. In other words, the app should be a branch of a business rather than the business itself.
</ul>
